This lesson explores the distribution of Extended Reality (XR) experiences, 
focusing on the various platforms and devices available for accessing these immersive applications. 

With XR's growing reach across Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), 
understanding how experiences are distributed is essential. 

This includes examining different types of platforms—ranging from app stores like Meta Horizon and Steam 
to web-based solutions—and considering factors such as platform compatibility, 
device requirements, and market reach, 
all of which shape the accessibility and success of XR content.

The lesson covers topics such as:

- Distributing VR experiences to potential users.
- Issues and challenges to consider.
- Interoperability of content on devices.
- Standards such as OpenXR and WebXR to underpin interoperablity.
