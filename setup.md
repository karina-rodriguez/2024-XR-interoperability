## Software Setup


### Details

During the lesson you will need to deploy a basic
web server. This will allow you to test some basic HTML + Javascript code.

In addition, you can make use of some datasets of your own, including
360 images or 360 video. If you don't have any available, please use the Data
Sets provided with this lesson.

To recap, you will need access to either:

1. Have access to a web server, e.g. [Brighton Domains](https://brighton.domains)
2. Have access to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy a simple web server in your own PC/laptop.

For more information how to use Docker, 
please refer to the lesson for the
[Docker introduction](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/docker-introduction/).
In particular, it would be good you complete the following:

- How do I know Docker is installed and running?
- How do I interact with Docker?
