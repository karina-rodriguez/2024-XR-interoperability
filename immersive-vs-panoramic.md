Firstly we must differentiate between a [raster **digital image**](https://karina-rodriguez.github.io/2024-VR-scene/mutlidimensional-content.html#digital-images) and a [vectorised **3D environment**](https://karina-rodriguez.github.io/2024-VR-scene/mutlidimensional-content.html#d-images-or-models) which allows
for interactivity, for example when visualising immersive 360 environments (e.g. VR).

As such, XR experiences could use content:

- Image-based rendering, as in 360 images and videos
- Vectorised-3D environments, as in an interactive virtual environment 


## Image-based rendering
These environments use 360 panoramas. Panoramas
record an environment from a central position with a view in every direction.
Users can rotate the camera view to select the direction to look at. Yet
they cannot move the camera within the environment.

These experiences can be easier/faster (cheaper) to produce an distribute as they only
require a rendered photograph or video to be displayed.



The idea of panoramic representation can be traced back to 20 A.D for example with 
the frescos in the houses in Pompeii[^1] (and probably even before). 
Techniques to capture panoramic views in photography started as early as photography itself. 

It was mostly used by photographers who were making a series of consequent photos, 
to show the whole city viewed from an elevated point. 

This is because a single photograph from far away could not show enough details of the scene.[^2]

### Panorama photographs

These are digital images which captures a 360 / wide-angle 
horizontal view or a broad perspective of a scene.

The digital images can be re-projected onto a cylinder or a sphere 
for visualisation. Although they can lack information when re-projecting on a sphere.

### Spherical panorama photographs

A spherical panorama photograph captures a full view of a 
scene in every direction, both horizontally and vertically, 
from the shooting point. 
Unlike traditional panoramas that cover a wide horizontal span, 
spherical panoramas allow viewers to look in 
any direction. 

It also known as a **photosphere**, **360-degree panorama** or **spherical panorama**. 
With special interactive viewers, it is possible to explore the image as if we were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by allowing the user to rotate with three degress of freedom interactivity[^3].

For high-quality resolution, cameras such as the [Insta360 Pro2](https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/pro2/en-us/basic/prepare/about), will produce an image of 7680 x 7680 (8K) pixles, and video of 7680 x 3840 pixels. 
These cameras can also support stereoscopic images.

## Vectorised-3D environment

These experiences are usually developed 
usually using a game engine to combine a vector-formatted 3D environment,
such as a 3D scene (inc. objects in the scene, as well as the camera, and lighting information).

It also allows for interactivity as the environment reacts
to the users' actions. 

In this fully immersive experience if a user can fully interact
with this visually-rich environment.

Resolution of the image usually depends on the rendering mechanism of
such environments.

## Stereoscopic versus No-Stereoscopic Content
Despite the modality of distribution, content can be accessed in 3D stereoscopic or non-stereoscopic mode.

To allow for 3D/stereoscopic model, it is necessary that a user 
has access to adequate hardware,
such as a VR headset or stereoscopic glasses.

This imposes additional requirements to the 
experience/content creator
as well as to the
the user in terms of hardware, and its
capabilities to access content.


For example, if 3D stereoscopic content is required,
then the user will need access to a headset.
It is possible to use a VR headset to work with a user's mobile phone
or a full VR headset (see examples below).
