The Degrees of Freedom a user has in an XR experience determine the 
level of 
movement they are allowed within the environment. We use this term,
as Degrees of Freedom (DoF) refer to the number of basic ways 
a rigid object can move through 3D space.

We normally distinguish between 3 or 6 degrees of freedom 
when describing XR experiences. See below for further information about each.


## 3 Degress of Freedom (3DoF)
In some cases, as user is restricted mostly to move their head to 
control where the camera is looking at within the environment. 

Head movement is mapped to rotational movement 
of the virtual camera around the x, y, and z axes, 
commonly termed pitch, yaw, and roll.

XR experiences with 3DoF are usually easy to distribute as
they do not require tracking the position of the user.
A smart phone can track the head movement 
by using its internal sensors. This experience
can be enhanced by carboard VR glasses as shown below.

Hence, XR experiences with 3DoF are commonly used 
to distribute 360 videos or images.

An example can be enabling users to visualise 
the interior of a house before purchasing, or visualise
a touristic space (see example below).
Note the user cannot move in these space

## 6-Degrees of Freedom (6 DoF)
With 6DoF, a user can also be tracked when moving across a space. 
That means beside tracking the head's pitch, yaw, and roll
the system also tracks whether the user has 
moved forward, backward, laterally, or vertically.


Being able to move within an XR experience, when combined
with other types of interaction, can potentially
increase the level of immersion and interactivity.

6DoF experiences require a user to have access to a tracking
system. Many VR systems already include sensors 
for tracking motion to enable this type of interactivity.

Examples of this type of environments include action games, for instance,
where a user needs to explore a space or where the user needs to avoid objects.
