All panoramas can be created using specialized panoramic cameras, 
wide-angle lenses, or by using software to stitch together 
photos taken from a single vantage point.
 
## 3DoF XR experiences on the web

Some websites allow for accessing 360 immersive image-renders 
with suitable interfaces for the user to move using 3DoF. 

When they don't have access to a device,
such as a mobile phone,
users can use the mouse to manipulate the virtual camera.

This type of experience allows for the wider access.



These allow for rendering an image or a video on the web.

### Challenge: Distributing XR experiences

In groups and using the Oculus quest, look at the various platforms with 3DoF content:

- [360 cities](https://www.360cities.net/)
- [Arts and Culture 360 videos](https://artsandculture.google.com/project/360-videos)
- [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/)
- [Valve Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [VR YouTube](https://vr.youtube.com/)
- [Facebook 360](https://www.facebook.com/Facebook360/)

Reflect on the easy of access, the potential number of users,
the richness of the content and on how the distribution platform 
might impact (or not) the amount 
of potential users.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Phone apps
Beside delivering 3DoF content websites, it is also possible
to develop mobile applications to be installed
on a device which allow interaction with this type of content.

For developing this type of experience,
the best option is to use an existing platform, or
your own code using HTML + Javascript libraries.

This type of viewer is called a photosphere viewer
as the image is mapped as a texture on a sphere.
Most platforms will only provide
the basic functionality to move around.
Hence, custom-made code is required to access 
more complex/interactive functionality.


## Platforms for distribution
There are many different platforms for distributing XR experiences. 
Here is a list of the most popular ones.

- [VR YouTube](https://vr.youtube.com/)
- [Facebook 360](https://www.facebook.com/Facebook360/)
- [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/)
- [Valve Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)


Note that they distribute content both through a web browser and 
through a device such as a phone or headset.

Beside these platforms, XR experiences can be installed as apps
on mobile phones through platforms such as Google and Apple apps:

- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/)
- [Windows App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps)
- [Google App Store](https://play.google.com/)

In most of these cases, the potential users is dependent on the
specific device they target.




You can also include your own viewer using existing libraries, for example:

- [Google VR view](https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/web/vrview-web)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- XR experiences can involve 3D environments or 360 images
- Distribution will depend on the modality, as well as whether the content is stereoscopic or not.
- The hardware that is available to users will have an impact 
on the functionality which can be accessed.
