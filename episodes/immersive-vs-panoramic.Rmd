## Types of content in XR experiences / applications

Distinction is made between environments which incorporate different type of content,
in particular:

- Vectorised-3D environments, as in an interactive virtual environment 
- Image-renderings, as in 360 images


### Vectorised-3D environment
These experiences are usually developed within a vector-formatted 3D environment,
such as the full 3D scene (inc. objects in the scene),
as well as the camera, and lighting information.

It allows for a more immersive experience if a user can fully interact
with this visually-rich environment.

It also allows for interactivity as the environment reacts
to the users' actions. 

Resolution of the image usually depends on the rendering mechanism of
such environments.

### Immersive image-renders
These environments are developed using 360 panoramas which record
an environment from a central position with a view in every direction.

Users can rotate the camera view to select the direction to look at. Yet
they cannot move within the environnment.

These experiences can be easier/cheaper to produce an distribute as they only
require a rendered photograph or video to be displayed.

However, allowing for high-quality imagery or interactivity might incurr
in a longer/more expensive development cycle. But also for an enhanced
user experience.

For high-quality resolution, cameras such as the [Insta360 Pro2](https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/pro2/en-us/basic/prepare/about), will produce an image of 7680 x 7680 (8K) pixles, and video of 7680 x 3840 pixels. These cameras can also support stereoscopic images.

## Stereoscopic versus No-Stereoscopic Content
Despite the modality of distribution, content can be acessed in 3D stereoscopic or non-stereoscopic mode.


To allow for 3D/stereoscopic model, it is necessary that a user 
has access to adequate hardware,
such as a VR headset or stereoscopic glasses.

This imposes additional requirements to the 
exprience/content creator
as well as to the
the user in terms of hardware, and its
capabilities to access content.


For example, if 3D stereoscopic content is required,
then the user will need access to a headset.
It is possible to use a VR headset to work with a user's mobile phone
or a full VR headset (see examples below).
