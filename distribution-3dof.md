## Examples of 3DoF Experiences

Some websites allow for accessing 360 immersive image-renders 
with suitable interfaces for the user to move using 3DoF. 
When they don't have access to a device,
such as a mobile phone,
users can use the mouse to manipulate the virtual camera.

This type of experience allows for the wider access.

See the following examples:

- [360 cities](https://www.360cities.net/)
- [Arts and Culture 360 videos](https://artsandculture.google.com/project/360-videos)

Beside delivering 3DoF content websites, it is also possible
to develop applications to be installed
on a device which allow interaction with this type of content.

## Developing 3DoF XR experiences on the web

For developing this type of experience,
the best option is to use an existing platform, or
your own code using HTML + Javascript libraries.

This type of viewer is called a photosphere viewer
as the image is mapped as a texture on a sphere.
Most platforms will only provide
the basic functionality to move around.
Hence, custom-made code is required to access 
more complex/interactive functionality.



Existing platforms include:

- [VR YouTube](https://vr.youtube.com/)
- [Facebook 360](https://www.facebook.com/Facebook360/)

You can also include your own viewer using existing libraries, for example:

- [Google VR view](https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/web/vrview-web)


These allow for rendering an image or a video on the web.

## Challenge: Distributing XR experiences

Explore how various types of experiences can be 
distributed to reach a wide number of users.

Reflect on how the distribution platform might impact (or not) the amount 
of potential users.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 


## Output
 
There are many different platforms for distributing XR experiences. 
Here is a list of the most popular ones.

- [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/)
- [Valve Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [VR YouTube](https://vr.youtube.com/)
- [Facebook 360](https://www.facebook.com/Facebook360/)

Note that they distribute content both through a web browser and 
through a device such as a phone or headset.

Beside these platforms, XR experiences can be installed as apps
on mobile phones through platforms such as Google and Apple apps:

- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/)
- [Windows App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps)
- [Google App Store](https://play.google.com/)

In most of these cases, the potential users is dependent on the
specific device they target.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- XR experiences can involve 3D environments or 360 images
- Distribution will depend on the modality, as well as whether the content is stereoscopic or not.
- The hardware that is available to users will have an impact 
on the functionality which can be accessed.
